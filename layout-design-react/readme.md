What we are looking for

Image editing skills in extracting design elements or recreating elements from a rasterised image.

The way you set up your files and folder structure for a site.
We're not looking for pixel perfection or exact font matching, but would like to also see how you adapt to a given design challenge and how closely you can produce the final work from a concept.

Minimal use of images, ideally we'd like to only see separate album art and all icon elements implemented as css sprites (http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/) or with similar Font Awesome (http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) or ionicons (http://ionicons.com/).

Sense of aesthetic and structure when it comes to re-interpreting design elements that might be difficult to implement in a simple manner.

Overall, we are seeking to understand how well you translate the idea into a beautiful front-end html/css asset for developers to implement the backend.
